# Build a slider in React with Framer Motion

Framer Motion is a really powerful animation and gesture library built for React. It's the successor to the Pose animation library, which you may be already familiar with. We will be using the package to create a slider with the ability to swipe/drag.

<Spacer />

#### Here's what we will be building:

<Slider />
<Spacer />

### Installing Framer-Motion

Install framer-motion to your project by using either yarn or npm

```
yarn add framer-motion
```

```
npm install framer-motion
```

Next step is to import the motion package into your component

```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion"
```

<Spacer />
