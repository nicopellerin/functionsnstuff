# Mutable variables

<Spacer margin="6rem 0 4rem 0" />

```rust
// By default, every variable in Rust is immutable
let c = 5;
c = 3;
Error - error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `c`

// To fix this error and make variable mutable, simply add `mut` to the variable
let mut c = 5;
c = 3;
```
